# Kotlin Microservices

Project about Microservices with Kotlin, Spring Cloud, Kafka, Kubernetes and Devops Culture.

## :mortar_board: Objective

The goal is to have a microservices environment as close as possible to the real environment and solve the maximum number of problems related to microservices architecture.
Creating from good practices for developing microservices at code level, through good devops practices to having an obserevability ecosystem.

- REST API
- Synchronous Communication with Feign(Spring Cloud)
- Asynchronous Communication with Kafka
- Circuit Break
- Kubernetes Containerization 
- Unit Test
- Integration Test
- Distributed Cache with Redis
- CI / CD
